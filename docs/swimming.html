        <h1 class="title"> After more than ten years, tech swimsuits are a thing of the past.</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">When tech swimsuits were banned in 2010, people thought it would be impossible to swim that
          fast again. They were wrong.</h2>
        <div class="byline">
          <p class="subtile is-6"><a href="../../index.html">Marco Dalla Stella</a></p>

        <p class="body-text serif"><q>Here, take this and see if it works for you!</q> exclaimed my swim coach, casually
          tossing a swimsuit unlike anything I had ever seen before.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Putting it on was a lengthy and arduous process. Once I wore it, it clung to my body
          like
          a second skin that extended from my ankles to the upper chest. It restricted my movements and the thought of
          swimming two miles with that thing on was unimaginable.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Reclutantly, I gave the new swimsuit a try. Lap after lap, my coach timed me
          meticulously, noting down the results in his notebook. Eventually, the evidence was clear: I was swimming
          faster.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text serif">In the late 1990s, a wave of technological advancement swept through competitive
          swimming, which led to the creation of swimsuits engineered to enhance buoyancy and stremline movement. These
          innovative suits were carefully engineered using wind tunnels testing.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">The grand stage for these pioneering swimsuits arrived with the 2000 Sydney Olimpics,
          where the local champion Ian Thorpe dominated the 400m freestyle while wearing a full-body suit that cloaked
          him
          from wrists to ankles. Among the eight finalists, only Romanian swimmer Dragos Coman wore a traditional slip
          swimsuit.</p>

        <p class="body-text serif">But the true revolution occurred a few years later, in February 2008, when Speedo
          unveiled the LZR Racer Suit in New York. This high-tech swimwear introduced polyurethane fabric which was
          meticulously tested in NASA's wind tunnels and bolstered by advanced flow analysis software.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">The Speedo LZR proved its superiority at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where it
          propelled
          athletes to smash an incredible 25 world records and 65 Olympic records. Other brands adapted, and hastened to
          develop their own polyurethan swimsuits. The trend continued in 2009 at the World Championships in Rome, where
          a
          jaw-dropping 43 world records were set.</p>

        <p class="body-text serif">Between 2008 and 2009, more world records were set than in the previous seven years.
          It
          comes as no suprise
          then, that <abbr title="Fédération internationale de natation">FINA</abbr>, the international governing body
          of swimming today known as World Aquatics, introduced a ban on non-textile swimsuits starting from the year
          2010.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">While <abbr title="Fédération internationale de natation">FINA</abbr>'s ban brought
          an end to the era of
          record-breaking swimsuits, it left existing records untouched, leaving the swimming community pondering an
          intriguing question: When will the sport catch up with its own evolution? Many believed that these seemingly
          invincible records would have lasted forever.</p>
        <p class="body-text serif">Fast forward more than a decade, only eight world records remain unbroken from the
          frenzy
          of the tech
          swimsuit era. Yet, a new generation of extraordinary swimmers has emerged, led by the likes of David
          Popovici, Thomas Ceccon, and Ariarne Titmus.</p>
        </p class="body-text serif">By looking at the average times of top-50 world performances in the four strokes, it
        is
        clear that today
        the sport as a whole has evolved in a way that surpassed even the incredible technological advancement of the
        polyurethane-based swimsuits.
